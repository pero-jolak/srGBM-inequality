# srGBM-inequality

This repository includes data and Python code for reproducing the empirical results in the paper: "Income Inequality and Mobility in geometric Brownian motion with stochastic resetting: Theoretical Results and Empirical Evidence of non-ergodicity":

* Code/srGBM.py - this file contains the code for the empirical analysis conducted in the paper.
* Data/rs.xlsx - data used for the approximation of the resetting rate
* Data/data_share.xlsx - data for the top 1% earners in USA
* Data/data_share10.xlsx - data for the top 10% earners in USA
* Data/perc_data.xslx - data for each percentile of the income distribution (used to fit t=0 parameters and simulate the initial N trajectories in 1977... this data, in full extent, can be used to fit an alternative economic measure, e.g. geometric mean income)
